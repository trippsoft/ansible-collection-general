  description: |
    This role generates an ACME TLS certificate.
    
    The role depends on the `trippsc2.general.generate_csr` role to generate a private key and CSR.
    
    The role depends on another role to set a DNS TXT record for the ACME challenge.

    The role does the following:
      - Runs the `trippsc2.general.generate_csr` role to generate a private key and CSR, if needed.
      - If the private key and CSR are generated, the role issues a dns-01 challenge to the ACME server.
      - The DNS role is responsible for setting the DNS TXT record for the ACME challenge.
      - Once the DNS record is set, the role will request the certificate from the ACME server and store it in the `cert_certificate_content` variable.
      - Optionally, the role will save the certificate to a file.
