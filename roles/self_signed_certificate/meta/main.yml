  role_name: self_signed_certificate
  description: |
    This role generates a self-signed TLS certificate.

    The role depends on the `trippsc2.general.generate_csr` role to generate a private key and CSR.

    The role does the following:
      - Runs the `trippsc2.general.generate_csr` role to generate a private key and CSR, if needed.
      - If the private key and CSR are generated, the role generates a self-signed certificate and stores it in the `cert_certificate_content` variable.
      - Optionally, the role will save the certificate to a file.
