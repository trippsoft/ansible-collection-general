  description: |
    This role generates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a Linux or Windows machine, if an existing certificate doesn't exist or needs renewal.

    The role should be used in conjunction with another role to sign the CSR and generate a certificate.

    This role does the following:
      - Checks if a certificate exists.
      - If the certificate does not exist or is near expiration, the role generates a private key and stores it at `cert_private_key_content`.
      - Optionally, the role will save the private key to a file and backup the replaced private key.
      - If the certificate does not exist or is near expiration, the role generates a CSR and stores it at `cert_csr_content`.
      - Optionally, the role will save the CSR to a file.
